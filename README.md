This is a Python module which can that can convert a paragraph of spoken english to written english.

## Installation:


  Requirements are python3 only.

		8, single 9 and triple 4.

	The input English Paragraph:
 		" Hi! My name is Bruce. I am a Programmer. I try to wake up before 6 A M. I always come home after 7 P M. I earn hundred dollars per day. My contact number contains double 5, quadruple 8, single 9 and triple 4."

## Here are some possible future functionalities that  can be covered in the future versions of the module:

1.   If the paragraph contains a money figure e.g. two million three thousand nine hundred and eighty-four then we may convert it to numbers as 2003984.

2. Handling of both American number system and Indian number system e.g. million, lakhs.

3.  Handling of Dates e.g. Today's Date is twenty-eight October two thousand twenty as Today's Date is 28-10-2020/2020-10-28.

4. Handling of Punctuation.

5. Handling of proper spaces after one sentance.
